AndEngineExamplesAndroidStudio
==============================

I have converted eclipse AndEngineExamples ( https://github.com/nicolasgramlich/AndEngineExamples ) as Android Studio project, also I have added all it's extensions as module dependencies, so now everything now are collected in one project.
If you want start new Andengine project, you should only change AndEngineExamples module and it's dependencies as well.
